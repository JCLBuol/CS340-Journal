-How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python 
 module in the future?
   By writing modular code that is well organized, using descriptive variable names and well documented code to keep things easy to identify are the best ways to keep programs maintainable, readable and adaptable.  By using the CRUD python module we were able to write a reusable function that could be used in multiple projects that would minimize code duplication and ensure consistent database access.  This module abstracts database specific details allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than database management.
 
-How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create 
 databases to meet other client requests?
   The first and most important step is to fully understand the problem and task at hand.  Then move on to developing a strategy for solving the problem.  By using iterative development steps you can break things down into smaller easier to handle steps and slowly build twoards the finished product.  I followed this process for this project with the exception of testing the code.  Since I was unable to get the software to run correctly I had to rely on writing good code and hope that I got the correct outcome in the end.
 
-What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists contribute to solving real-world problems, improving processes, and enabling businesses like Grazioso Salvare to operate more effectively in a data-driven world. The application of computer science principles and tools can lead to innovation and success in various industries.
